# Permission Higher Order Component
Proof of Concept Higher Order Component that adds a disable editing checkbox to all blocks that will prevent certain user roles from editing the block when checked.

Built using the [WordPress Create Block Script](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/create-block).

To get up and running, pull this block into your WordPress plugins directory, `cd` into the block and run the following commands:

`npm install`
`npm run build`

This will compile the assets into the build folder.
